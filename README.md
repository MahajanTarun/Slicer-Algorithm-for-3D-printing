# Slicer-Algorithm-for-3D-printing-
This is a slicer algorithm form meant for learning and understanding how 3D printing and CAD software works.

Did you ever thought <b>"How CAD, and other 3D model rendering softwares works?"</b> Here you can start your exploration, starting with <b>Slicer Algorithm</b>

NOTE:
This project includes Slicer algorithm, which is used specifically for ASCII .stl file extention. No other files will work for this algorithm.

Also please make sure the input parameters uses float datatype. To use .stl files with integer type, change the ImportSTL file definition.

Will be uploading more support for different file formats. 

Support and contributions will be appreciated. :)
